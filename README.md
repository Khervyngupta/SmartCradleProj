# IoT based Smart Cradle 

â€¢The proposed system uses the cloud service for remotely monitoring the child.This is majorly based on the concept of protecting child from theft in hospitals. The present quick paced world makes it hard for parents to continuously look after their kid. After long working hours, it is hard for parents to constantly watch out for their kid. To help such parents, this paper represents the idea of a SMART CRADLE SYSTEM.. Besides, there are extra features or functions provided by the newly automatic cradle that are beneficial for parents. m. Smart cradle systems for child monitoring using IoT allows parents to monitor the child through the Mobile application and centralized web application 

## Objective
â€¢	To design the development of an embedded system which can convert any ordinary cradle into smart one when it is used with that cradle. 
â€¢	To make a baby cradle safe and comfortable for the baby with the use of various sensors to monitor the baby 's life through the camera as well as to detect bed-wet conditions to keep the baby away from an unhygienic environment.
â€¢	To make cradle innovation that is more flexible and less expensive to the Indian market.
â€¢	To capture the face of any intruder who is trying to steal the baby and immediately detect the unrecognized face and send the notification to the parentsâ€™ device with image of the intruder.

## Novelty
â€¢	Recognizing the face of intruder and notification with image of unknown intruder is immediately sent to parentsâ€™ device.
â€¢	We have developed a band which is integrated with pulse sensor  and temperature sensor that can be used for a child which reduces any harm to the child.
â€¢	To check whether the diaper of baby is wet or not , the humidity sensor is used with babyâ€™s bedsheet.
â€¢	The system will switch on the buzzer as soon as it finds the baby is not inside the cradle and is only stolen by any unrecognized person and notifies the concerned authorities immediately.

## Inventive Step
â€¢	The image is captured by installed camera in system and is sent to cloud.

â€¢	The image processing is controlled by the Raspberry Pie.It filters the data and check  if it matches it with previous data( on cloud) of known/authorized persons(Parents and hospital staffs),it will be doing nothing. Else if the data doesnâ€™t match, it send the intruderâ€™s image to the parentsâ€™ device.

â€¢	Django framework is used for frontend of web application and Python is used for training data modules, face matching and machine learning for processing the image.

â€¢	Pulse sensor, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, Raspberry pie 4,Node MCU, Breadboard, Jumper Wires, Buzzer, Adapter are used as a physical devices in developing a system.
â€¢	Interfacing of Arduino using Arduino C programming

â€¢	Interfacing of Android Mobile Application using Android programming (Java + XML)


## Industrial Applicability
â€¢	Ground survey of 50 homes and 10 hospitals  has been done in order to understand the need and acceptability of our designed product.
â€¢	Alpha testing and Beta testing are also done in prospect of acknowledging the function of the system developed by us.
â€¢	This can be used efficiently in hospitals having proper technological availability.
â€¢	This will be cheaper than the existing baby monitoring smart cradles so that it would be affordable for hospitals and middle-class homes also.
â€¢	This project is not about carrying the whole cradle but only the small system that will be performing all the functions . 

## Economic viability
â€¢	This project is not about carrying the whole cradle but only the small system that will be performing all the functions .
â€¢	We have developed not the cradle but the technically equipped smart device that  can be integrated with any type of  simple cradle available in market.
â€¢	The system developed is embedded with less costly technical   equipments(NodeMCU,SimpleJumper Wires,Breadboards,etc) which makes the overall cradle cheaper.
